### **December 3- Digit manipulation**
- **Problem**
  - Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.  Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.
- **Example**
  ```bash
  For n = 1230, the output should be isLucky(n) = true
  For n = 239017, the output should be isLucky(n) = false
  ```
- **Resources**
  - The basic functionality needed to solve this problem is extracting all the digits from a number and manipulate it according to your needs for which this link can be used.
